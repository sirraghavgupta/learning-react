what is the benefit of react running on browser? what if it was not there?
single page vs multi page

virtual dom 
map, filter, reduce 
eslint 
more extensions

let a = {
name : "Sanskriti" ,
x : function () {
      console.log("Outer",this.name)
      var self = this
       function showname () {
        console.log("Inner",self.name)
     }
     showname();
}
};
